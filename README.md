# Project-Laura
Code-art to show my girlfriend the beauty that can be described by mathematics.

- [solar_system_simple](solar_system_simple/) Simulate a solar system with simple physics engine. Orbital radius is set, and the velocity required for circular orbit is calculated, then randomly tweaked to produce elliptical orbits. Planets are attracted to the sun only, not eachother.
