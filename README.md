# Project-Laura
**Code-art project to show Laura beautiful things can be made with math.**

### These are demos you can open right from your browser, they're built with javascript (p5.js)

- **morph** ([demo2](https://michaelruppe.github.io/Project-Laura/morph/02/index.html)) ([demo1](https://michaelruppe.github.io/Project-Laura/morph/01/index.html)): More experiments with `noise()`
![A screenshot from demo2](/morph/screenshot.png)
- **flow field** ([demo](https://michaelruppe.github.io/Project-Laura/flow_field/index.html)): Sprinkles particles onto a slowly changing force vector field. The field is updated with perlin noise and the particles trace their trajectory. It procedurally draws images that look something like this:

- [Fern](fern): A procedurally generated fractal fern. See [Wiki: Barnsley Fern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern)
![The Barnsley Fern after a few minutes](/fern/Screenshot_1.jpg)

- ![Rainy Pi](rainy_pi): Count raindrops that fall randomly on a square and a circle with equal "diameter". The ratio of the counts can be used to approximate the value of Pi!

### These are demos built with [Processing](https://processing.org/). You'll have to [download the repo](https://github.com/michaelruppe/Project-Laura/archive/master.zip) to run them.
- [solar_system_simple](solar_system_simple/): Simulate a solar system with simple physics engine. Elliptical orbits made by calculating velocity for circular orbit then randomly tweaking.
