# Project-Laura
**Code-art project to show my girlfriend beautiful things can be made with math.**

- [solar_system_simple](solar_system_simple/): Simulate a solar system with simple physics engine. Orbital radius is set, and the velocity required for circular orbit is calculated, then randomly tweaked to produce elliptical orbits. Planets are attracted to the sun only, not eachother.
- [flow_field](flow_field): Sprinkles particles onto a slowly changing force vector field. The field is updated with perlin noise and the particles trace their trajectory.
