# Project-Laura
**Code-art project to show my girlfriend beautiful things can be made with math.**

### These are demos you can open right from your browser, they use p5.js
- [flow field](flow_field): Sprinkles particles onto a slowly changing force vector field. The field is updated with perlin noise and the particles trace their trajectory. It procedurally draws images that look something like this:
![A flow field after about half a minute](/flow_field/screenshot.png "Flow Field")
![A flow field after a few minutes](/flow_field/screenshot2.png "Flow Field")
- [Fern](fern): A procedurally generated fractal fern. See [Wiki: Barnsley Fern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern)

### These are demos built with [Processing](https://processing.org/). You'll have to [download the repo](https://github.com/michaelruppe/Project-Laura) to run them.
- [solar_system_simple](solar_system_simple/): Simulate a solar system with simple physics engine. Elliptical orbits made by calculating velocity for circular orbit then randomly tweaking.
